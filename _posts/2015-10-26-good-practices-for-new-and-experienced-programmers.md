title: Good Practices for New and Experienced Programmers
---
One skill that can help every programmer is the ability to "whiteboard" problems. The basic idea of whiteboarding is that you will use plain language to create logical step-by-step instructions on how to solve a particular problem. You can use a real whiteboard or a simple legal pad to whiteboard.

I have found that using a real pen/pencil/marker can drastically change how I think about solving problems. Whiteboarding helps translate thoughts and ideas into something written, without getting tripped up with syntax or non-related problems. It helps expose flaws in logic that you can quickly add or make changes.

Whiteboard problems also happen to be commonly used in interviews. You might be interviewing with someone who is more familiar using a different programming language. However, since the two of you are using plain language, you still can communicate effectively on how to solve a problem.
