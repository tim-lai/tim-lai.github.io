title: Pair Programming
---
Pair programming is a method for two programmers to work together. One partner "navigates" by talking, the other partner "drives" by typing. The key point is that no one does both tasks at the same time. The benefit is that both partners are always engaged. It is okay and even recommended to trade roles periodically, so that both partners gain practice and skills in talking and coding.

Pair programming is great for two programmers of similar abilities. Ideas and code can be generated faster when two people are attacking the same problem together. The pair can get "unstuck" faster because the partner might have different ideas and perspectives.

Pair programming also work for two programmers of different abilities. The stronger skilled partner should be the navigator, and the primary role is to transfer knowledge of the codebase to the partner. The less skilled partner should be the driver, and the primary role is gain familiarity coding in the actual codebase. 

In time, the skill gap between the two partners should close significantly. This will create a high performing pair where each partner can anticipate the other effectively, and the pair will generate even higher quality code at a faster rate. 

In addition, the same pair of programmers can have different skillset levels depending on the task at hand. One partner might be stronger setting up servers, while the other might be stronger querying databases. This would be a great opportunity to switch roles. The net result is expertise with both server setup and database querying.

Tips on Pair Programming
- Whiteboard plan of action, and be able to verbally describe what you want and expect to do before typing anything. 
- Focus on collaborating well with your partner. 
- Utilize good use of debugging skills to execute code and return results, rather than guessing what your code will do.
- Get into the practice of "Commit early, and commit often."
