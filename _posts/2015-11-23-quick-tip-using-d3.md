title: Quick Tip - Using the D3.js Javascript Library
---
The D3 library is an amazing libary that you can use to produce dynamic interactive data visualizations. Here are two quick tips to getting you started with D3. 

- Each D3 library has its own formatting requirements. There is no standard dataset structure that you can use. I used the same dataset for three different visualization libraries, but one of them wanted the data structured in a very different way. 
- Playing with the visualization settings is similar to playing with CSS and positioning. It is very easy to go down a rabbit hole. Remember to focus on the basic visualization functionality first, then worry about styling details.
