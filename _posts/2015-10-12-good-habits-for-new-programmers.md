title: Good Habits for New Programmers
---
I found that the best practice to improving your programming skills is by coding every single day. In the beginning, start at 10 - 15 minutes per day. The initial goal is to get used to "think in code" as well as good syntax practices. Focus on working code, and not on being too clever or efficient. 

As you get more comfortable, build up your daily coding time in 15 minute increments, until you can sustain writing code for at least an hour every day. The key idea is to build a habit of daily repetition. You will rapidly see improvement in your skills and abilities. 

Of course, depending your goals, you might need to practice coding for more than an hour a day. However, coding is just like everything else... you need to start somewhere.
